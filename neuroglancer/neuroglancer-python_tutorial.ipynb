    "# Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to introduce you to the Python interface to Neuroglancer. There are several advantages for using the Python interface over using the visualization links generated at the braincogs00.pni.princeton.edu site. The main advantage is that it gives you programmatic control over your Neuroglancer session. This helps for making reproducible figures via the screenshot feature. It also allows you to keep the Neuroglancer session open indefinitely, whereas the links on braincogs00 expire after a few hours of inactivity. If you are making annotations and that takes longer than a single sitting, you could lose your progress if the Neuroglancer session is closed. This notebook prevents that from happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what we will cover in this notebook:\n",
    "- Start a Neuroglancer session from Python and load in public data \n",
    "- Manipulate the Neuroglancer session from Python\n",
    "- Configure a screenshot reproducibly\n",
    "- Load in your private light-sheet data"

    "# Setup\n",
    "In order to run the code in this notebook, you will need a conda environment with python3 and containing some additional libraries. This environment, which I call \"ng\" below but you could call whatever you want, can be set up in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "In terminal:\n",
    "- conda create -n ng python=3.8 -y\n",
    "- conda activate ng # (or source activate ng, depending on which version of conda you have)\n",
    "- pip install cloud-volume\n",
    "- pip install neuroglancer <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\\# To enable you to use jupyter notebooks to work with this environment as a kernel:\n",
    "In terminal:\n",
    "- conda activate ng\n",
    "- pip install --user ipykernel\n",
    "- python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ng\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is all installed, make sure to select this conda environment as the kernel when running this notebook via Kernel -> Change Kernel (you may have to restart the jupyter notebook server if you just created the conda environment)"
