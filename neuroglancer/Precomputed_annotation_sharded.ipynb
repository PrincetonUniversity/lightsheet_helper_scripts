    "# Precomputed_annotation_sharded\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to figure out how to create sharded precomputed annotation layers and to determine when they are needed for performance in terms of number of annotations. Refer to this document: https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed/annotations.md for the general structure of these precomputed annotation layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I have been able to successfully create a precomputed annotation layer without sharding. This works well for up to a 10^5 annotations, but once you get above that the load time starts to suffer. To get faster load times, sharding is recommended. There are multiple steps to take to enable sharding. Here are some things that I know do NOT change. Note that that I'm not using relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "In the info file the following keys stay the same:\n",
    "- \"@type\"\n",
    "- \"annotation_type\"\n",
    "- \"dimensions\"\n",
    "- \"lower_bound\"\n",
    "- \"upper_bound\"\n",
    "- \"properties\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves the remaining properties which may change:\n",
    "- \"by_id\"\n",
    "- \"spatial\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example public layer which uses sharding: https://storage.googleapis.com/neuroglancer-20191211_fafbv14_buhmann2019_li20190805/. To download the info file do:\n",
    "```\n",
    "gsutil cp gs://neuroglancer-20191211_fafbv14_buhmann2019_li20190805/info .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example info file the `by_id` key looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"by_id\" : {\n",
    "  \"key\" : \"by_id\",\n",
    "  \"sharding\" : {\n",
    "     \"@type\" : \"neuroglancer_uint64_sharded_v1\",\n",
    "     \"data_encoding\" : \"gzip\",\n",
    "     \"hash\" : \"murmurhash3_x86_128\",\n",
    "     \"minishard_bits\" : 13,\n",
    "     \"minishard_index_encoding\" : \"gzip\",\n",
    "     \"preshift_bits\" : 0,\n",
    "     \"shard_bits\" : 5\n",
    "  }\n",
    "},\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are multiple entries to the `spatial` key. The docs state that this key is defined as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Array of JSON objects specifying the spatial index levels from coarse to fine\n",
    "```\n",
    "The coarse to fine suggests that this works like downsampling where we have multiple mip levels. \n",
    "the first of these objets is one that looks like what we are used to from not sharding:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "     \"chunk_size\" : [ 884397, 442585, 282601 ],\n",
    "     \"grid_shape\" : [ 1, 1, 1 ],\n",
    "     \"key\" : \"spatial0\",\n",
    "     \"limit\" : 10000\n",
    "  },\n",
    "```\n",
    "But unlike in our example, this chunk size is huge and needs downsampling. According to the docs this should be the coarsest level (i.e. largest chunks with fewest of them). That does appear to be the case since this chunk size is the size of `upper_bound` - `lower_bound` . The `grid_shape` is defined as `Array of rank positive integers specifying the number of cells along each grid dimension for this spatial index level.` So a cell must be how the space is divided up. So in this case there is just a single cell over the entire volume. This must be a very low resolution chunk since not all points would be able to be rendered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next entry to the `spatial` array looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "     \"chunk_size\" : [ 442198.5, 442585, 282601 ],\n",
    "     \"grid_shape\" : [ 2, 1, 1 ],\n",
    "     \"key\" : \"spatial1\",\n",
    "     \"limit\" : 10000,\n",
    "     \"sharding\" : {\n",

    "        \"hash\" : \"identity\",\n",
    "        \"minishard_bits\" : 0,\n",
    "        \"minishard_index_encoding\" : \"gzip\",\n",
    "        \"preshift_bits\" : 0,\n",

    "  },\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we see this is `spatial1` and the chunk size is half the size in the x dimension. The grid shape indicates two cells in that dimension. The other dimensions are the same as `spatial0`. Note the addition of the `sharding` key to this dictionary. This is how we tell Neuroglancer that this is a sharded level. In fact all of the subsequent spatial levels have this key. The keys of this sharding dictionary are explained here: https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed/sharded.md#sharding-specification. The keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"@type\": Must be \"neuroglancer_uint64_sharded_v1\".\n",
    "- \"preshift_bits\": Specifies the number of low-order bits of the chunk ID that do not contribute to the hashed chunk ID. The hashed chunk ID is computed as hash(chunk_id >> preshift_bits).\n",
    "- \"hash\": Specifies the hash function used to map chunk IDs to shards. Must be one of:\n",
    "\"identity\": The identity function.\n",
    "\"murmurhash3_x86_128\": The MurmurHash3_x86_128 hash function applied to the shifted chunk ID in little endian encoding. The low 8 bytes of the resultant hash code are treated as a little endian 64-bit number.\n",
    "- \"minishard_bits\": Specifies the number of bits of the hashed chunk ID that determine the minishard number. The number of minishards within each shard is equal to 2**minishard_bits. The minishard number is equal to bits [0, minishard_bits) of the hashed chunk id.\n",
    "- \"shard_bits\": Specifies the number of bits of the hashed chunk ID that determine the shard number. The number of shards is equal to 2**shard_bits. The shard number is equal to bits [minishard_bits, minishard_bits+shard_bits) of the hashed chunk ID.\n",
    "- \"minishard_index_encoding\": Specifies the encoding of the \"minishard index\". If specified, must be \"raw\" (to indicate no compression) or \"gzip\" (to indicate gzip compression). If not specified, equivalent to \"raw\".\n",
    "- \"data_encoding\": Specifies the encoding of the actual chunk data, in the same way as \"minishard_index_encoding\". In the case of multiscale meshes, this encoding applies to the manifests but not to the mesh fragment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things I still don't understand here, but maybe I can understand them by comparing the contents of the layer shown here: https://storage.googleapis.com/neuroglancer-20191211_fafbv14_buhmann2019_li20190805/ with what's in the info file. Let's start with `spatial0`. There exists a folder called `spatial0` and its only contents are the file: `0_0_0`. This is the same as when we were not doing sharding. Now it's not clear whether this file would contain every single point. Having downloaded that file it is a very small file: 480K. So I bet it is just a small fraction of the points. Let's see if we can use `struct.unpack()` to looks at the contents of that binary file. We should be able to figure out the total number of points since they are listed at the beginning of the file as a uint64 little endian. I was able to do that with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open(spatial0_0_0_0_file, \"rb\") as f:\n",
    "    byte = f.read(8) # the first 8 bytes represent the uint64 value for total number of annotations\n",
    "    print(struct.unpack('<Q',byte))\n",
    "```\n",
    "And the answer is 10071 annotations in this file. \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so either there are many more annotations than this \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions for Jeremy: \n",
    "- How do you decide which points to show in the coarsest spatial0/0_0_0 file? \n",
    "- What are the by_id/00.shard files? In the unsharded example I don't even have this by_id folder."

It is the `B` code (see: https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html and this comment: https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/issues/227#issuecomment-913152865). Since uint8 is the smallest of the byte sizes compared to the other properties, it goes last in the format string. Let's just say we want to encode rgba and skip rgb. To encode coordinates (float32), cell size (float32), cell type (uint16), and rgba (4x uint8), the format string should be:\n",
